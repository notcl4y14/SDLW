# SDLW

SDLW (SDL Wrapped) is a project I've been coding for fun, but later decided to publish it. It consists of SDL's tools wrapped in classes and redefinitions in a single namespace. However a few changes and simplifiyings are applied as well. And, of course, it does NOT wrap EVERYTHING. SDLW uses SDL3.

## Requirements

The only requirements are SDL's headers and binaries. That's it, except it's also required to -I the SDL3's and SDLW's header directories (only their outer directories). I'm planning to shorten these requirements.
